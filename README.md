# MedCPT: Zero-shot Biomedical IR Model

## Overview

![image](https://github.com/ncbi/MedCPT/assets/32558774/6c1bde8d-1930-4df0-a120-16bb7f0e0d3a)

MedCPT is a first-of-its-kind Contrastive Pre-trained Transformer model trained with an unprecedented scale of PubMed search logs for zero-shot biomedical information retrieval. MedCPT consists of:
- A frist-stage dense retriever (MedCPT retriever)
  - Contains a query encoder (QEnc) and an article encoder (DEnc), both initialized by [PubMedBERT](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/BiomedNLP-PubMedBERT-base-uncased-abstract-fulltext).   
  - Trained by 255M query-article pairs from PubMed search logs and in-batch negatives. 
- A second-stage re-ranker (MedCPT re-ranker)
  - A transformer cross-encoder (CrossEnc) initialized by [PubMedBERT](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/BiomedNLP-PubMedBERT-base-uncased-abstract-fulltext).
  - Trained by 18M semantic query-article pairs and localized negatives from the pre-trained MedCPT retriever. 

## Training MedCPT

This directory contains:
- [Code](./retriever/) for training the MedCPT retriever.
- [Code](./reranker/) for training the MedCPT re-ranker.
- [Code](./evals/) for evaluating the pre-trained model.

## Using MedCPT

MedCPT model weights are publicly available on Hugging Face:
- [MedCPT Query Encoder](https://huggingface.co/ncbi/MedCPT-Query-Encoder)
- [MedCPT Article Encoder](https://huggingface.co/ncbi/MedCPT-Article-Encoder)

### Using the MedCPT Query Encoder

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("ncbi/MedCPT-Query-Encoder")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("ncbi/MedCPT-Query-Encoder")

queries = [
	"diabetes treatment", 
	"How to treat diabetes?", 
	"A 45-year-old man presents with increased thirst and frequent urination over the past 3 months.",
]

with torch.no_grad():
	# tokenize the queries
	encoded = tokenizer(
		queries, 
		truncation=True, 
		padding=True, 
		return_tensors='pt', 
		max_length=64,
	)
	
	# encode the queries (use the [CLS] last hidden states as the representations)
	embeds = model(**encoded).last_hidden_state[:, 0, :]

	print(embeds)
	print(embeds.size())
```
The output will be:
```bash
tensor([[ 0.0413,  0.0084, -0.0491,  ..., -0.4963, -0.3830, -0.3593],
        [ 0.0801,  0.1193, -0.0905,  ..., -0.5380, -0.5059, -0.2944],
        [-0.3412,  0.1521, -0.0946,  ...,  0.0952,  0.1660, -0.0902]])
torch.Size([3, 768])
```
These embeddings are also in the same space as those generated by the MedCPT article encoder. 

### Using the MedCPT Article Encoder
```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("ncbi/MedCPT-Article-Encoder")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("ncbi/MedCPT-Article-Encoder")

# each article contains a list of two texts (usually a title and an abstract)
articles = [
	[
		"Diagnosis and Management of Central Diabetes Insipidus in Adults",
		"Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a clinical syndrome which results from loss or impaired function of vasopressinergic neurons in the hypothalamus/posterior pituitary, resulting in impaired synthesis and/or secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP). [...]",
	],
	[
		"Adipsic diabetes insipidus",
		"Adipsic diabetes insipidus (ADI) is a rare but devastating disorder of water balance with significant associated morbidity and mortality. Most patients develop the disease as a result of hypothalamic destruction from a variety of underlying etiologies. [...]",
	],
	[
		"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus: a comprehensive overview",
		"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is characterized by the inability to concentrate urine that results in polyuria and polydipsia, despite having normal or elevated plasma concentrations of arginine vasopressin (AVP). [...]",
	],
]

with torch.no_grad():
	# tokenize the queries
	encoded = tokenizer(
		articles, 
		truncation=True, 
		padding=True, 
		return_tensors='pt', 
		max_length=512,
	)
	
	# encode the queries (use the [CLS] last hidden states as the representations)
	embeds = model(**encoded).last_hidden_state[:, 0, :]

	print(embeds)
	print(embeds.size())
```
The output will be:
```bash
tensor([[-0.0189,  0.0115,  0.0988,  ..., -0.0655,  0.3155, -0.0357],
        [-0.3402, -0.3064, -0.0749,  ..., -0.0799,  0.3332,  0.1263],
        [-0.2764, -0.0506, -0.0608,  ...,  0.0389,  0.2532,  0.1580]])
torch.Size([3, 768])
```
These embeddings are also in the same space as those generated by the MedCPT query encoder. 


## Data availability

Due to [privacy](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/web_policies.html#privacy_security) concerns, we are not able to release the PubMed user logs. As a surrogate, we provide the question-article pair data from [BioASQ](http://www.bioasq.org/) in this repo as example training datasets. You can convert your data to the example data formats and train the MedCPT model.
